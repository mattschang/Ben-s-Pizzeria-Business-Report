# Ben-s-Pizzeria-Business-Report

"Ben's Pizzeria Business Report" is a replication of a SQL data analysis project that was originally created by Adam Finer of LearnBI.online. This project takes place under a hypothetical scenario where a client, Ben, has requested business insights for his pizzeria, specifically on order activity, inventory management, and staff. I designed a 10-table relational database from multiple CSV datasets using QuickDBD. The SQL queries pertaining to information of on order activity, inventory management, and staff were conducted using PostgreSQL via pgAdmin. The final business insights are delineated on a three-page interactive dashboard that was created on Looker studio.
